# Hi, I'm Zen!

I'm a non-binary 20 year old CS major and "Wolf of All Trades".

- 🎓 I'm studying at [WPI](https://wpi.edu/).
- 💻 I'm a software engineer (and more) at [ConCat](https://concat.app/).
- 🌎 My [website](https://zen.gay/) is a bit barren but I like the simplicity.
- ☁️ Check me out on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/zen.gay).
